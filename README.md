# Real-Time Segmentation and Classification of Whole-Slide Images for Tumor Biomarker Scoring

Our custom models are located in the code folder with their respective names. To execute the code, simply copy the file from the code folder and paste it into the "stardist-> models-> model2d.py" file. For instance, if you wish to run the resnet50_unet model, copy the code from "code-> model2d_resnet50_unet.py" and paste it into "stardist-> models-> model2d.py."
